The pdf documentation found in LipSync Pro 1.2 and below is still included for completeness and is still accurate, but it doesn't cover all features found in 1.4.
New documentation is being put together at lipsync.rogodigital.com/documentation. This is still being worked on, so more information will arrive over time.
